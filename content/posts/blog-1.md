For the previous half of this semester, I have been working with my Software Innovations II class to add to the [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) repository. During this time, I have learned more about Markdown, Python, documentation, and more through this team work environment. When investigating thematic, hard, and soft breaks in Markdown and how to represent them in Python, it turned out that it is actually quite hard to represent hard breaks for Markdown in Python, potentially even impossible, but with my lacking experience with Python I was unable to find a way to represent them so for the time being it is impossible to me. The research that I did do was some what minimal after I found a tutorial that let me experiment around with the breaks in Markdown, while it also pointed some of them out to me. This work was ultimately used to ensure the tool accurately counted the number of paragraphs in the file being checked.
